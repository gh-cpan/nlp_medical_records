REDACTED ne ee nt nee TEST PRI REDACTED IPLE FoundationOne CDx REDACTED is performed exclusively as a laboratory service using DNA extracted from formalin fixed paraffin embedded FFPE tumor samples The assay employs a single DNA extraction method from routine FFPE biopsy or surgical resection specimens 50 1000 ng of which will undergo whole genome shotgun library construction and hybridization based capture of all coding exons from 309 cancer related genes one promoter region one non coding ncRNA and select intronic regions from 34 commonly rearranged genes 21 of which also include the coding exons refer to Table 2 and Table 3 for complete list of genes included in REDACTED In total the assay detects alterations in a total of 324 genes Using the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform hybrid capture selected libraries are sequenced to high uniform depth targeting 500X median coverage with 99 of exons at coverage 100X Sequence data is then processed using a customized analysis pipeline designed to detect all classes of genomic alterations including base substitutions indels copy number alterations amplifications and homozygous gene deletions and selected genomic rearrangements e g gene fusions Additionally genomic signatures including microsatellite instability MSI tumor mutational burden TMB and positive homologous recombination deficiency HRD status 83RCA positive and or LOH high are reported PERFORMA REDACTED E CHARACTERISTICS Please refer to product label foundationmedicine com ficdx WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 1 Alterations reported may include somatic not inherited or germline inherited alterations however the test does not distinguish between germline and somatic alterations The test does not provide information about susceptibility 2 Biopsy may pose a risk to the patient when archival tissue is not available for use with the assay The patient s physician should determine whether the patient is a candidate for biopsy 3 REDACTED testing to an alternative FDA approved companion diagnostic should be performed for patients who have an REDACTED amplification result detected with copy number equal to 4 baseline ploidy of tumor 2 for confirmatory testing While this result is considered negative by FoundationOne CDx REDACTED in a clinical concordance study with an FDA approved FISH test 70 7 out of 10 samples were positive and 30 3 out 10 samples were negative by the FISH test with an average ratio of 2 3 The REDACTED signed by REDACTED REDACTED 01 August 2022 REDACTED REDACTED Ph D Laboratory Director CLIA 22D2027531 REDACTED REDACTED Laboratory

mycancergenome org content disease breast cancer REDACTED 238 report the frequency of REDACTED overexpression as 20 in breast cancer Based on the REDACTED REDACTED CDx concordance study approximately 10 of REDACTED amplified samples had copy number 4 Thus total frequency is conservatively estimated to be approximately 2 LIMITATIONS 1 For in vitro diagnostic use 2 For prescription use only This test must be ordered by a qualified medical professional in accordance with clinical laboratory regulations 3 A negative result does not rule out the presence of a mutation below the limits of detection of the assay 4 Samples with 25 tumor may have decreased sensitivity for the detection of CNAs including ERBBz 5 Clinical performance of REDACTED osimertinib in patients with an EGFR exon 20 T790M mutation detected with an allele fraction 5 is ongoing and has not been established 6 Concordance with other validated methods for CNA with the exception of ERBBz reported under tumor profiling and gene rearrangement with the exception of ALK FGFR2 NTRK1 2 3 and ROSz detection has not been demonstrated and will be provided in the post market setting Confirmatory testing using a clinically validated assay should be performed for all CNAs and fusions other than those listed in Table 1 7 For patients with solid tumors whose samples have MSI scores 0 0041 and 0 0124 an MSI Cannot Be Determined result is reported Patients with this result should be retested with a validated orthogonal alternative method as these MSI scores represent a range of scores with low reliability The likelihood of a patient receiving this result is 3 29 within solid tumors 8 Patients with solid tumors may also receive an MSI status reported as Cannot Be Determined due to a quality control REDACTED failure When all sample level quality metrics are met the rate of MSI Cannot Be Determined results due to a REDACTED failure is 8 96 Patients with this result should consider re testing with FoundationOne CDx or an orthogonal alternative method if clinically appropriate 9 TMB by REDACTED is determined by counting all synonymous and non synonymous variants present at 5 allele frequency or greater after filtering and the total number is reported as mutations per megabase mut Mb unit Observed TMB is dependent on characteristics of the specific tumor focus tested for a patient e g primary vs metastatic tumor content and the testing platform used for the detection therefore observed TMB results may vary between different specimens for the same patient and between detection methodologies employed on the same sample The TMB calculation may differ from TMB calculations used by other assays depending on variables such as the amount of genome interrogated percentage of tumor assay limit of detection LoD filtering of alterations included in the score and the read depth and other bioinformatic test specifications Refer to the REDACTED for a detailed description of these variables in FMI s TMB calculation https www accessdata fda gov cdrh_docs pdf17 P170019B pdf The clinical validity of TMB defined by this panel has been established for TMB as a qualitative output for a cut off of 10 mutations per megabase but has not been established for TMB as a quantitative score 10 Decisions on patient care and treatment must be based on the independent medical judgment of the treating physician taking into consideration all applicable information concerning the patient s condition such as patient and family history physical examinations information from other diagnostic tests and patient preferences in accordance with the standard of care in a given community Tl The test is intended to be performed on specific serial number controlled instruments by Foundation Medicine Inc 12 Alterations in polyT homopolymer runs may not be reliably detected in REDACTED T3 Certain large rearrangements in REDACTED including large scale genomic deletions affecting at least one whole exon insertions or other deleterious genomic rearrangements including inversions or transversion events may not be detected in an estimated 5 of ovarian cancer patients with REDACTED mutations by REDACTED

EQUIVOCAL AND SUBCLONAL An alteration denoted as amplification equivocal implies that the FoundationOne CDx assay data provide some but not unambiguous evidence that the copy number of a gene exceeds the threshold for identifying copy number amplification The threshold used in FoundationOne CDx for identifying a copy number amplification is four 4 for erep2 and six 6 for all other genes Conversely an alteration denoted as loss equivocal implies that the FoundationOne CDx assay data provide some but not unambiguous evidence for homozygous deletion of the gene in question An alteration denoted as subclonal is one that the FoundationOne CDx analytical methodology has identified as being present in 10 of the assayed tumor DNA PROFESSIONAL SERVICES FINDINGS Incorporates analyses of peer reviewed studies and other publicly available information identified by Foundation Medicine these analyses and information may include associations between a molecular alteration or lack of alteration and one or more drugs with potential clinical benefit or potential lack of clinical benefit including drug candidates that are being studied in clinical research Note A finding of biomarker alteration does not necessarily indicate pharmacologic effectiveness or lack thereof of any drug or treatment regimen a finding of no biomarker alteration does not necessarily indicate lack of pharmacologic effectiveness or effectiveness of any drug or treatment regimen RANKING OF THERAPIES AND CLINICAL TRIALS Ranking of Therapies in Summary Table Therapies are ranked based on the following criteria

that the FoundationOne CDx assay data provide some but not unambiguous evidence that the copy number of a gene exceeds the threshold for identifying copy number amplification The threshold used in FoundationOne CDx for identifying a copy number amplification is four 4 for ERBB2 and six 6 for all other genes Conversely an alteration denoted as loss equivocal implies that the FoundationOne CDx assay data provide some but not unambiguous evidence for homozygous deletion of the gene in question An alteration denoted as subclonal is one that the FoundationOne CDx analytical methodology has identified as being present in 10 of the assayed tumor DNA PROFESSIONAL SERVICES FINDINGS Incorporates analyses of peer reviewed studies and other publicly available information identified by

from formalin fixed paraffin embedded FFPE tumor samples The assay employs a single DNA extraction method from routine FFPE biopsy ot surgical resection specimens 50 1000 ng of which will undergo whole genome shotgun library construction and hybridization based capture of all coding exons from 309 cancer related genes one promoter region one non coding ncRNA and select intronic regions from 34 commonly rearranged genes 21 of which also include the coding exons refer to Table 2 and Table 3 for complete list of genes included in FaCDx In total the assay detects alterations in a total of 324 genes Using the Iumina HiSeq gooo platform hybrid capture selected libraries are sequenced to high uniform depth targeting 500X median coverage with 99 of exons at coverage 100X Sequence data is then processed using a customized analysis pipeline designed to detect all classes of genomic alterations including base substitutions indels copy number alterations amplifications and homozygous gene

QUALIFIED ALTERATION CALLS CEQUIVOCAL AND SUBCLONALD An alteration denoted as amplification equivocal implies that the FoundationOne CDx assay data provide some but not unambiguous evidence that the copy number of a gene exceeds the threshold for identifying copy number amplification The threshold used in FoundationOne CDx for identifying a copy number amplification is four 4 for ERBB2 and six 6 for all other genes Conversely an alteration denoted as loss equivocal implies that the FoundationOne CDx assay data provide some but not unambiguous evidence for homozygous deletion of the gene in question An alteration denoted as subclonal is one that the FoundationOne CDx analytical methodology has identified as being present in 10 of the assayed tumor DNA PROFESSIONAL SERVICES FINDINGS Incorporates analyses of peer reviewed studies and other publicly available information identified by Foundation Medicine these analyses and information may include associations between a molecular alteration or lack of alteration and one or more drugs with potential clinical benefit or potential lack of clinical benefiti including drug candidates that are being studied in clinical research Note A finding of biomarker alteration does not necessarily indicate pharmacologic effectiveness or lack thereof of any drug or treatment regimen a finding of no biomarker alteration does not necessarily

Limitations Guardant360 TissueNext sequences 84 cancer associated genes to identify somatic alteratlons Genomic DNA gDNA is extracted from an FFPE tissue specimen enriched for targeted regions and sequenced using the REDACTED platform and hg19 as the reference genome All exons ave sequenced In some genes only clinically signifleant exons are sequenced In other genes The types of genomic alterations detected by Guardant360 TissueNext include single nucleotide variants SNVs copy number variants fusions rearrangements short insertion deletions indets and splice site disrupting events see Table 1 Microsatellite Instability MSI is assessed for all cancer types by evaluating somatic changes in the length of repetitive sequences on the Guardant860 TissueNext panel Tumor mutational burden T MB score Is calculated for all cancer types from somatic SNVs and Indels in exons of 500 genes detected in the gDNA extracted from that tisaue specimen followed by adjusting for the size of the panel A Not Evaluable result is an inconclusive result in samples where the tumor fraction is Insufficient 20 or the highest variant allele traction is below 10 Certain sample or variant characteristics such as small sample size or low tumor fraction may result in reduced analytic sensitivity The absence of detectable somatic alterations does not preclude the presence of somatic alterations in the tumor Guardant360 TissueNext cannot discern the source of variation and for some variants with variant allele fractions in the range of 40 to 60 the test cannot easily distinguish rare or private germline variants from somatic alterations Guardant 60 TissueNext is not validated for the detection of germline or de nove variants that are associated with hereditary cancer risk

Information Provided as a Professional Service _ vee ot oe ene J QUALIFIED ALTERATION CALLS EQUIVOCAL AND SUBCLONAL An alteration denoted as amplification equivocal implies that the FoundationOne CDx assay data provide some but not unambiguous evidence that the copy number of a gene exceeds the threshold for identifying copy number amplification The threshold used in FoundationOne CDx for identifying a copy number amplification is four 4 for ERBB2 and six 6 for all other genes Conversely an alteration denoted as loss equivocal implies that the FoundationOne CDx assay data provide some but not unambiguous evidence for homozygous deletion of the gene in question An alteration denoted as subclonal is one that the FoundationOne CDx analytical methodology has identified as being present in 10 of the assayed tumor DNA PROFESSIONAL SERVICES FINDINGS Incorporates analyses of peer reviewed studies and other publicly available information identified by Foundation Medicine these analyses and information may include associations between a molecular alteration or lack of alteration and one or more drugs with potential clinical benefit or potential lack of clinical benefit including drug candidates that are being studied in clinical research Note A finding of biomarker alteration does not necessarily indicate pharmacologic effectiveness or lack thereof of any drug or treatment regimen a finding of no biomarker alteration does not necessarily indicate lack of pharmacologic effectiveness or effectiveness of any drug or treatment regimen RANKING OF THERAPIES AND CLINICAL TRIALS

REDACTED ne ee nt nee TEST PRI REDACTED IPLE FoundationOne CDx REDACTED is performed exclusively as a laboratory service using DNA extracted from formalin fixed paraffin embedded FFPE tumor samples The assay employs a single DNA extraction method from routine FFPE biopsy or surgical resection specimens 50 1000 ng of which will undergo whole genome shotgun library construction and hybridization based capture of all coding exons from 309 cancer related genes one promoter region one non coding ncRNA and select intronic regions from 34 commonly rearranged genes 21 of which also include the coding exons refer to Table 2 and Table 3 for complete list of genes included in REDACTED In total the assay detects alterations in a total of 324 genes Using the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform hybrid capture selected libraries are sequenced to high uniform depth targeting 500X median coverage with 99 of exons at coverage 100X Sequence data is then processed using a customized analysis pipeline designed to detect all classes of genomic alterations including base substitutions indels copy number alterations amplifications and homozygous gene deletions and selected genomic rearrangements e g gene fusions Additionally genomic signatures including microsatellite instability MSI tumor mutational burden TMB and positive homologous recombination deficiency HRD status 83RCA positive and or LOH high are reported PERFORMA REDACTED E CHARACTERISTICS Please refer to product label foundationmedicine com ficdx WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 1 Alterations reported may include somatic not inherited or germline inherited alterations however the test does not distinguish between germline and somatic alterations The test does not provide information about susceptibility 2 Biopsy may pose a risk to the patient when archival tissue is not available for use with the assay The patient s physician should determine whether the patient is a candidate for biopsy 3 REDACTED testing to an alternative FDA approved companion diagnostic should be performed for patients who have an REDACTED amplification result detected with copy number equal to 4 baseline ploidy of tumor 2 for confirmatory testing While this result is considered negative by FoundationOne CDx REDACTED in a clinical concordance study with an FDA approved FISH test 70 7 out of 10 samples were positive and 30 3 out 10 samples were negative by the FISH test with an average ratio of 2 3 The REDACTED signed by REDACTED REDACTED 01 August 2022 REDACTED REDACTED Ph D Laboratory Director CLIA 22D2027531 REDACTED REDACTED Laboratory Director CLIA 34D2044309 Foundation Medicine Inc 1 888 988 3639 frequency of REDACTED copy number 4 in breast cancer is estimated to be approximately 2 Multiple references listed in https www mycancergenome org content disease breast cancer REDACTED 238 report the frequency of REDACTED overexpression as 20 in breast cancer Based on the REDACTED REDACTED CDx concordance study approximately 10 of REDACTED amplified samples had copy number 4 Thus total frequency is conservatively estimated to be approximately 2 LIMITATIONS 1 For in vitro diagnostic use 2 For prescription use only This test must be ordered by a qualified medical professional in accordance with clinical laboratory regulations 3 A negative result does not rule out the presence of a mutation below the limits of detection of the assay 4 Samples with 25 tumor may have decreased sensitivity for the detection of CNAs including ERBBz 5 Clinical performance of REDACTED osimertinib in patients with an EGFR exon 20 T790M mutation detected with an allele fraction 5 is ongoing and has not been established 6 Concordance with other validated methods for CNA with the exception of ERBBz reported under tumor profiling and gene rearrangement with the exception of ALK FGFR2 NTRK1 2 3 and ROSz detection has not been demonstrated and will be provided in the post market setting Confirmatory testing using a clinically validated assay should be performed for all CNAs and fusions other than those listed in Table 1 7 For patients with solid tumors whose samples have MSI scores 0 0041 and 0 0124 an MSI Cannot Be Determined result is reported Patients with this result should be retested with a validated orthogonal alternative method as these MSI scores represent a range of scores with low reliability The likelihood of a patient receiving this result is 3 29 within solid tumors 8 Patients with solid tumors may also receive an MSI status reported as Cannot Be Determined due to a quality control REDACTED failure When all sample level quality metrics are met the rate of MSI Cannot Be Determined results due to a REDACTED failure is 8 96 Patients with this result should consider re testing with FoundationOne CDx or an orthogonal alternative method if clinically appropriate 9 TMB by REDACTED is determined by counting all synonymous and non synonymous variants present at 5 allele frequency or greater after filtering and the total number is reported as mutations per megabase mut Mb unit Observed TMB is dependent on characteristics of the specific tumor focus tested for a patient e g primary vs metastatic tumor content and the testing platform used for the detection therefore observed TMB results may vary between different specimens for the same patient and between detection methodologies employed on the same sample The TMB calculation may differ from TMB calculations used by other assays depending on variables such as the amount of genome interrogated percentage of tumor assay limit of detection LoD filtering of alterations included in the score and the read depth and other bioinformatic test specifications Refer to the REDACTED for a detailed description of these variables in FMI s TMB calculation https www accessdata fda gov cdrh_docs pdf17 P170019B pdf The clinical validity of TMB defined by this panel has been established for TMB as a qualitative output for a cut off of 10 mutations per megabase but has not been established for TMB as a quantitative score 10 Decisions on patient care and treatment must be based on the independent medical judgment of the treating physician taking into consideration all applicable information concerning the patient s condition such as patient and family history physical examinations information from other diagnostic tests and patient preferences in accordance with the standard of care in a given community Tl The test is intended to be performed on specific serial number controlled instruments by Foundation Medicine Inc 12 Alterations in polyT homopolymer runs may not be reliably detected in REDACTED T3 Certain large rearrangements in REDACTED including large scale genomic deletions affecting at least one whole exon insertions or other deleterious genomic rearrangements including inversions or transversion events may not be detected in an estimated 5 of ovarian cancer patients with REDACTED mutations by REDACTED 14 Certain potentially deleterious missense or small in frame deletions in REDACTED may not be reported under the CDx associated findings but may be reported in the Other alterations and biomarkers

qualitative next generation sequencing based in vitro diagnostic device that uses targeted high throughput hybridization based capture technology for detection of single nucleotide variants SNVs insertions and deletions indels in 55 genes copy number amplifications CNAs in two 2 genes and fusions in four 4 genes Guardant360 REDACTED utilizes circulating cell free DNA cfDNA from plasma of peripheral whole blood collected in Streck Cell Free DNA Blood Collection Tubes BCTs The test is intended to be used as a companion diagnostic to identify non small cell lung cancer NSCLC patients who may benefit from treatment with the targeted therapy listed in Table 1 in accordance with the approved therapeutic product labeling Table 1 Companion Diagnostic Indications Indication Biomarker Therapy Non small cell lung cancer NSCLC REDACTED 19 deletions L858R and T790M TAGRISSO osimertinib A negative result from a plasma specimen does not assure that the patient s tumor is negative for genomic findings NSCLC patients who are negative for the biomarkers listed in Table 1 should be reflexed to tissue biopsy testing for Table 1 biomarkers using an FDA approved tumor tissue test if feasible The efficacy of TAGRISSO osimertinib has not been established in the REDACTED T790M plasma positive tissue negative or unknown population and clinical data for T790M plasma positive patients are limited therefore testing using plasma specimens is most appropriate for consideration in patients from whom a tumor biopsy cannot be obtained Additionally the test is intended to provide tumor mutation profiling to be used by qualified health care professionals in accordance with professional guidelines in oncology for cancer patients with any solid malignant neoplasm The test is for use with patients previously diagnosed with cancer and in conjunction with other laboratory and clinical findings Genomic findings other than those listed in Table 1 are not prescriptive or conclusive for labeled use of any specific therapeutic product Guardant360 REDACTED is a single site assay performed at Guardant Health Inc Warnings and Precautions Alterations reported may include somatic not inherited or germline inherited alterations The assay filters germline variants from reporting except for pathogenic REDACTED BR REDACTED 2 ATM and CDK12 alterations However if a reported alteration is suspected to be germline confirmatory testing should be considered in the appropriate clinical context The test is not intended to replace germline testing or to provide information about cancer predisposition Somatic alterations in ATM and CDK12 are not reported by the test as they are excluded from the test s reportable range Genomic findings from cfDNA may originate from circulating tumor DNA ctDNA fragments germline alterations or non tumor somatic alterations such as clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential CHIP Allow the tube to fill completely until blood stops flowing into the tube Underfilling of tubes with less than 5 mL of blood bottom of the label indicates 5 mL fill when tube is held vertically may lead to incorrect analytical results or poor product performance This tube has been designed to fill with 10 mL of blood Limitations For in vitro diagnostic use For prescription use only This test must be ordered by a qualified medical professional in accordance with clinical laboratory regulations The efficacy of TAGRISSO osimertinib has not been established in the REDACTED T790M plasma positive tissue negative or unknown population and clinical data for T790M plasma positive patients are limited therefore testing using plasma specimens is most appropriate for consideration in patients from whom a tumor biopsy cannot be obtained TAGRISSO efficacy has not been established in patients with REDACTED exon 19 deletions 0 08 MAF in patients with REDACTED 0 09 MAF and in patients with REDACTED T790M 0 03 MAF The test is not intended to be used for standalone diagnostic purposes The test is intended to be performed on specific serial number controlled instruments by Guardant Health Inc Anegative result for any given variant does not preclude the presence of this variant in tumor tissue Decisions on patient care and treatment must be based on the independent medical judgment of the treating physician taking into consideration all applicable information concerning the patient s condition such as patient and family history physical examinations information from other diagnostic tests and patient preferences in accordance with the standard of care ctDNA shedding rate may be lower in patients with primary central nervous system CNS tumors Definition of Categories The test report includes genomic finding reported in the following

REDACTED assoctated Cancer Risk Men only Men with the HOXB73 variant identified in this individual have been shown to have a greatly increased risk for prostate cancer Risks appear fo be highest in men with a family history of prostate cancer All of the studies to date have focused on men of Europeari ancestry so there is not enough evidence yet to know if this variant in REDACTED leads fo an increased risk for prostate cancer in men of other ancestries Some studies have shown that men with this variant in REDACTED are more likely to be diagnased with prostate cancer at younger ages than men in the general population At this time there are no established cancer risks for women with this variant or other variants in REDACTED Although there are high cancer risks for men with this variant in REDACTED there may be interventions that can reduce these risks The initial guidelines from the Philadeiphia Prostate Cancer Consensus Conference are listed below Since it is likely that these guidelines will change as we lear more about the cancer risks associated with this variant in REDACTED it may be appropriate to interpret these results in consultation with cancer genetics professionals who have expertise in this emerging area of knowledge Notes for Personalized Management INFORMATION ON HOW CANCER RISKS AND MANAGEMENT ARE DETERMINED The myRisk Management Tool provides cancer risk levels based on analysis of genetic test results see myRisk Genetic Result and a summary of medical society management recommendations based on a combined analysis of the genetic test results and when possible personal clinical factors and personal family cancer history Here are some important points to understand as you interpret this test report and decide on the best plan for management Comprehensive patient management The management recommendations presented in this report are a summary of management options recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network NCCN and other medical societies and are general in nature The patient s actual management should be modified based on personal medical histary surgeries and other treatments A comprehensive risk assessment and management plan may take into account this report and other aspects of the patient s personal family medical history e g all known clinical diagnoses as well as lifestyle environmental and other factors Risk estimates based on provider supplied information Same of the risk estimates and management recommendation summaries provided in this report are based on our interpretation of Information supplied by the ordering health care provider on the test request form see Specifications for Personal Family History analysis at myriad com technical specifications The patient s actual risks and appropriate management may be significantly different if details provided for cancer diagnoses ages family relationships or other factors were incorrect omitted arnbiguous or have since changed Please review the clinical history listed on the Clinical Family History Information page of this report to make sure that the information used was provided and interpreted correctly Variability in REDACTED risk estimates REDACTED estimates of breast cancer risk can vary significantly based on the way in which the model is used and the estimate provided here may be higher or lower than what would be calculated by other users For complete details of haw REDACTED calculates REDACTED risk estimates including how REDACTED handles information provided in a format not compatible with the model please see the Specifications for Personal Family History analysis at myriad com technical specifications These Specifications also include information for recalculating the REDACTED breast cancer risk estimate if desired What is meant by High Risk and Elevated Risk In the Genetic Test Result Summary a gene associated cancer risk is described as High Risk for a cancer type if all of the following conditions are met the absolute risk of cancer is approximately 5 or higher the increase in risk aver the general population is approximately 3 fold or higher and there is significant data from muitiple studies supporting the cancer risk estimate A gene is described as Elevated Risk for a cancer type if there is sufficient data to support an increase in cancer risk over the general population risk but not all criteria for High Risk are met INFORMATION FOR FAMILY MEMBERS Family mem REDACTED s should talk fo their healthcare providers about hereditary cancer testing to help define their own risk and assist in the interpretation of this patient s genetic test result This patient s relatives are at risk for carrying the same mutation s and associated cancer risks as this patient

extracted from formalin fixed paraffin embedded FFPE tumor samples The assay employs a single DNA extraction method from routine FFPE biopsy or surgical resection specimens 50 1000 ng of which will undergo whole genome shotgun library construction and hybridization based capture of all coding exons from 309 cancer related genes one promoter region one non coding ncRNA and select intronic regions from 34 commonly rearranged genes 21 of which also include the coding exons refer to Table 2 and Table 3 for complete list of genes included in REDACTED In total the assay detects alterations in a total of 324 genes Using the Ilumina HiSeq 4000 platform hybrid capture selected libraries are sequenced to high uniform depth targeting 500X median coverage with 99 of exons at coverage 100X Sequence data is then processed using a customized analysis pipeline designed to detect all classes of genomic alterations including base substitutions indels copy number alterations amplifications and homozygous gene deletions and selected genomic rearrangements e g gene fusions Additionally genomic signatures including microsatellite instability MSI tumor mutational burden TMB and positive homologous recombination deficiency HRD status BRCA positive and or LOH high are reported Please refer to product lab foundationmedicine com ficdx 7 Alterations reported may include somatic not inherited or germline inherited alterations however the test does not distinguish between germline and somatic alterations The test does not provide information about susceptibility 2 Biopsy may pose a risk to the patient when archival tissue is not available for use with the assay The patient s physician should determine whether the patient is a candidate for biopsy 3 REDACTED testing to an alternative FDA approved companion diagnostic should be performed for patients who have an ERBBz amplification result detected with copy number equal to 4 baseline ploidy of tumor 2 for confirmatory testing While this result is considered negative by FoundationOne CDx REDACTED in a clinical concordance study with an FDA approved FISH test 70 7 out of 10 samples were positive and 30 3 out 10 samples were negative by the FISH test with an average ratio of 2 3 The in p go frequency of REDACTED copy number 4 in breast cancer is estimated to be approximately 2 Multiple references listed in https www mycancergenome org content disease breast cancer REDACTED report the frequency of REDACTED overexpression as 20 in breast cancer Based on the FiCDx REDACTED CDx concordance study approximately 10 of REDACTED amplified samples had copy number 4 Thus total frequency is conservatively estimated to be approximately 2 For in vitro diagnostic use For prescription use only This test must be ordered by a qualified medical professional in accordance with clinical laboratory regulations A negative result does not rule out the presence of a mutation below the limits of detection of the assay Samples with 25 tumor may have decreased sensitivity for the detection of CNAs including REDACTED Clinical performance of REDACTED osimertinib in patients with an EeFR exon 20 T7g0M mutation detected with an allele fraction 5 is ongoing and has not been established Concordance with other validated methods for CNA with the exception of exse2 and gene rearrangement with the exception of ALK detection has not been demonstrated and will be provided in the post market setting Confirmatory testing using a clinically validated assay should be performed for all CNAs and rearrangements not associated with CDx claims noted in Table 1 of the Intended Use but used for clinical decision making For patients with solid tumors whose samples have MSI scores 0 0041 and 0 0124 an MSI Cannot Be Determined result is reported Patients with this result should be re tested with a validated orthogonal alternative method as these MSI scores represent a range of scores with low reliability Patients with solid tumors may also receive an MSI status reported as MSI Cannot Be Determined due to a quality control REDACTED failure Patients with this result should consider re testing with FoundationOne CDx or an orthogonal alternative method if clinically appropriate TMB by FiCDx is determined by counting all synonymous and non synonymous variants present at 5 allele frequency or greater after filtering and the total number is reported as mutations per megabase mut Mb unit Observed TMB is dependent on characteristics of the specific tumor focus tested for a patient eg primary vs metastatic tumor content and the testing platform used for the detection therefore observed TMB results may vary between different specimens for the same patient and between detection methodologies employed on the same sample The TMB calculation may differ from TMB calculations used by other assays depending on variables such as the amount of genome interrogated percentage of tumor assay limit of detection LoD filtering of alterations included in the score and the read depth and other bioinformatic test specifications Refer to the REDACTED for a detailed description of these variables in FMI s TMB calculation https waw accessdata fda gov cdrh_docs pdf17 P170019B pdf The clinical validity of TMB defined by this panel has been established for TMB as a qualitative output for a cut off of 1o mutations per megabase but has not been established for TMB as a quantitative score Decisions on patient care and treatment must be based on the independent medical judgment of the treating physician taking into consideration all applicable information concerning the patient s condition such as patient and family history physical examinations information from other diagnostic tests and patient preferences in accordance with the standard of care in a given community The test is intended to be performed on specific serial number controlled instruments by Foundation Medicine Inc Alterations in polyT homopolymer runs may not be reliably detected in REDACTED Certain large rearrangements in REDACTED including large scale genomic deletions affecting at least one whole exon insertions or other deleterious genomic rearrangements including inversions or transversion events may not be detected in an estimated 5 of ovarian cancer patients with REDACTED mutations by FiCDx Certain potentially deleterious missense or small in frame deletions in REDACTED may not be reported under the CDx associated findings but may be reported in the Other alterations and biomarkers identified section in the patient report 74 Alterations at allele frequencies below the established limit of detection may not be detected consistently 5 Detection of LOH has been verified only for ovarian cancer patients

alterations Genomic DNA gDNA is extracted from an FFPE tissue specimen enriched for targeted regions and sequenced using the fllumina platform and hg19 as the reference genome All exons are sequenced in some genes only clinically significant exons are secuenced in other genes The types of genomic alterations detected by REDACTED include single nucleotide variants SNVs copy number variants fusions rearrangements short insertions celetions indels anc splice site disrupting events see Table 1 Microsatellite Instability MSN is assessed for all cancer types by evaluating somatic changes in the fengih of repetitive sequences on the Guardant360 TissueNext panel Tumor mutational burden TMB score is calculated for all cancer types from somatic SNVs and indels in exons of 500 genes cetecied in the gDNA extracted fram that tissue specimen followed by adjusting for the size of the panel A Not Evaluable result is an inconclusive result in samples where the tumor fraction is insufficient 20 96 or the highest variant alleie fraction is below 10 Certain sample or variant characteristics such as srnali sample size or low turner fraction may result in reduced analytic sensitivity The absence of detectahle somatic alterations dees not preclude the presence of sematic alterations in the tumor Guarcarnt36D TissueNext cannot discern the source of variatian and for some variants with variant allele fractions in the range of 40 to GD the test cannot easily distinguish rare or private germline variants from somatic alterations Guardanta60 FissueNext is not validated for the cetection of
