assay data provide some but not unambiguous evidence that the copy number of a gene exceeds the threshold for identifying copy number amplification The threshold used in FoundationOne CDx for identifying a copy number amplification is four 4 for ERBB2 and six 6 for all other genes Conversely an alteration denoted as loss equivocal implies that the FoundationOne CDx assay data provide some but not unambiguous evidence for homozygous deletion of the gene in question An alteration denoted as subclonal is one that the FoundationOne CDx analytical methodology has identified as being present

qualitative next generation sequencing based in vitro diagnostic device that uses targeted high throughput nybridization based capture technology for detection of single nucleotide variants SNVs insertions and deletions indels in 55 genes copy number amplifications CNAs in two 2 genes and fusions in four 4 genes REDACTED utilizes circulating cell free DNA cfDNA from plasma of peripheral whole blood collected in Streck Cell Free DNA Blood Collection Tubes BCTs The test is intended to be used as a companion diagnostic to identify non small cell lung cancer NSCLC patients who may benefit from treatment with the targeted therapy listed in Table 1 in accordance with the approved therapeutic product labeling Table 1 Companion Diagnostic Indications Indication Biomarker Therapy Non small cell lung cancer NSCLC REDACTED 19 deletions L858R and T790M TAGRISSO osimertinib A negative result from a plasma specimen does not assure that the patient s tumor is negative for genomic findings NSCLG patients who are negative for the biomarkers listed in Table 1 should be reflexed to tissue biopsy testing for Table 1 biomarkers using an FDA approved tumor tissue test if feasible The efficacy of TAGRISSO osimertinib has not been established in the REDACTED T790M plasma positive tissue negative or unknown population and clinical data for T790M plasma positive patients are limited therefore testing using plasma specimens is most appropriate for consideration in patients from whom a tumor biopsy cannot be obtained Additionally the test is intended to provide tumor mutation profiling to be used by qualified health care professionals in accordance with professional guidelines in oncology for cancer patients with any solid malignant neoplasm The test is for use with patients previously diagnosed with cancer and in conjunction with other laboratory and clinical findings Genomic findings other than those listed in Table 1 are not prescriptive or conclusive for labeled use of any specific therapeutic product REDACTED is a single site assay performed at Guardant Health Inc Warnings and Precautions Alterations reported may include somatic not inherited or germline inherited alterations The assay filters germline variants from reporting except for pathogenic REDACTED BR REDACTED 2 ATM and CDK12 alterations However if a reported alteration is suspected to be germiine confirmatory testing should be considered in the appropriate clinical context The test is not intended to replace germline testing or to provide information about cancer predisposition Somatic alterations in ATM and CDK12 are not reported by the test as they are excluded from the test s reportable range Genomic findings from cfDNA may originate from circulating tumor DNA ctDNA fragments germline alterations or non tumor somatic alterations such as clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential CHIP Allow the tube to fill completely until blood stops flowing into the tube Underfilling of tubes with less than 5 mL of blood bottom of the label indicates 5 mL fill when tube is held vertically may lead to incorrect analytical results or poor product performance This tube has been designed to fill with 10 mL of blood Limitations For in vitro diagnostic use For prescription use only This test must be ordered by a qualified medical professional in accordance with clinical jaboratory regulations The efficacy of TAGRISSO osimertinib has not been established in the REDACTED T790M plasma positive tissue negative or unknown population and clinical data for T790M plasma positive patients ate limited therefore testing using plasma specimens is most appropriate for consideration in patients from whom a tumor biopsy cannot be obtained TAGRISSO efficacy has not been established in patients with REDACTED exon 19 deletions 0 08 MAF in patients with REDACTED 0 09 MAF and in patients with REDACTED T790M 0 03 MAF The test is not intended to be used for standalone diagnostic purposes The test is intended to be performed on specific serial number controlled instruments by Guardant Heaith Inc Anegative result for any given variant does not preclude the presence of this variant in tumor tissue Decisions on patient care and treatment must be based on the independent medical judgment of the treating physician taking into consideration all applicable information

labeled use of any specific therapeutic product REDACTED is a single site assay performed at Guardant Health Inc Warmings and Precautions Alterations reported may include somatic not inherited or germline inherited alterations The assay filters germline variants from reporting except for pathogenic BRCAT BRCA2 ATM and CDK12 alterations However if a reported alteration is suspected to be germline confirmatory testing should be considered in the appropriate clinical context The test is not intended to replace germline testing or to provide information about cancer predisposition Somatic alterations in ATM and CDK12 are not reported by the test as they are excluded from the test s reportable range Genomic findings from cfDNA may originate from circulating tumor DNA ctDNA
