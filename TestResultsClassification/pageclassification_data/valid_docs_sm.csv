REPORT DATE 20 Nov 2019 TEST PRINCIPLE FoundationOne CDx will be performed exclusively as a laboratory service using DNA extracted from formalin fixed paraffin embedded FFPE tumor samples The proposed assay will employ 4 single DNA extraction method from routine FFPE biopsy or surgical resection specimens 50 1000 ng of which will undergo whole genome shotgun library construction and hybridization based capture of all coding exons from 309 cancer related genes one promoter region one non coding ncRNA and select intronic regions from 34 commonly rearranged genes 21 of which elso include the coding exons The assay therefore includes detection of alterations in a total of 324 genes Using the REDACTED HiS5eq 4000 platform hybrid capture selected libraries will be sequenced to high uniform depth targeting g0o0X median coverage with 99 of exons at coverage 100X Sequence data will be processed using a customized analysis pipeline designed to accurately detect all classes of genomic alterations including base substitutions indels focal copy number amplifications homozygous gene deletions and selected genomic rearrangements e g gene fusions Additionally genomic signatures including loss of heterozygosity LOH score microsatellite instability MS and tumor mutational burden TMB will be reported PERFOR REDACTED NCE CHARACTERISTICS Flease refer to product label foundationmedicine com facdx LIMITATIONS 1 For in vitro diagnostic use 2 For prescription use only This test must be ordered by a qualified medical professional in accordance with clinical laboratory regulations 3 A negative result does not rule out the presence of a mutation below the limits of detection of the assay 4 Samples with 25 tumor may have decreased sensitivity for the detection of CNAs including REDACTED 5 Clinical performance of REDACTED osimertinib in patients with an EGFR exon 29 T7g0M mutation detected with an allele fraction 5 Is ongoing and has not been established 6 Concordance with other validated methods for CNA with the exception of REDACTED and gene rearrangement with the exception of ALK detection has not been demonstrated and will be provided in the post market setting Confirmatory testing using 4 clinically validated assay should be performed for all CNAs and rearrangements not associated with CDx claims noted in Table 1 of the Intended Use but used for clinical decision making 7 The MSI H MS5 designation by FMI FiCDx test is based on genome wide analysis of 95 microsatellite loci and not based on the 5 or 7 MSI loci deseribed in current clinical practice fuidelines Refer to https www accessdata fda gov edrh_doca pdfs7 P170029B pdf for additional details on methodology The threshold for MSI H MSS was determined by analytical concordance to comparator assays IHC and PCR using uterine cecum and colorectal cancer FFPE tissue Patients with Microsatellite statua of Cannot Be Determined should be retested with an orthogonal alternative method The clinical validity of the qualitative MSI designation has not been established 8 TMB by FiCDsx is defined based on counting the total number of all synonymous and non synonymous variants present at 4 allele frequency or greater after filtering and reported as mutations per megabase mut Mb unit rounded to the nearest integer The clinical validity of TMB defined by this panel has not been established 9 Decisions on patient care and treatment must be based on the independent medical judgment of the treating physician taking into consideration all applicable information concerning the patients condition such as patient and family history physical examinations information from other diagnostic tests and patient preferences in accordance with the standard of care in a given community 10 The test is intended to be performed on specific serial number controlled instruments by Foundation Medicine Inc 11 Alterations in polyT homopolymer runs may not be reliably detected in BRGA1 2 12 Certain large rearrangements in BRCA1 2 including large scale genomic deletions affecting at least one whole exon insertions or other deleterious genomic rearrangements including inversions or transversion events may not be detected in an estimated 5 of ovarian cancer patients with BRCAi 2 mutations by FiCDx 13 Certain potentially deleterious missense or small in frame deletions in BRCA1 2z may not be reported under the CDx associated findings but may be reported in the Other alterations and biomarkers identified section in the patient report 14 Alterations at allele frequencies below the established limit of detection may not be detected consistently 15 Detection of LOH has been verified only for ovarian cancer patients 16 Performance of the LOH classification has not been established for samples below 36 tumor content and with LOH scores near the cutoff of 16 17 There may be potential interference of ethanol with LOH detection The interfering effects of xylene

FoundationOne CDx for identifying a copy number amplification s four 4 for ERBB2 and six 6 for all ather genes Cotversely an alteration denoted as loss equivocal implies that the FoundationOne CDx assay data provide some but not unambiguous evidence for homozygous delction of the gene in question An alteration denoled as subslonal is one that the FoundationOne CDx analytical methodology has identified as being present in 10 of the assayed tumor DNA PROFESSIONAL SERVICES FINDINGS Incorporales analyses of peer reviewed studies and other publicly available information identified by

a Professional Service QUALIFIED ALTERATION CALLS EGUIVOCAL AND SUBCLONAL An alteration denated as amplification equivocal implies that the FoundationOne CDx assay data provide some but not unambiguous evidence that the copy number of a gene exceeds the threshold for identifying copy number amplification The threshold used In FoundationOne CDx for identifying a copy number amplification is four 4 for ERBR and six 6 for all other genes Conversely an alteration denoted as loss equivocal implics that the FoundationOne CDx assay data provide some but not unambiguous evidence for homozygous deletion of the gene in question An alteration denoted as subclonal is one that the FoundationOne CDx analytical methodology has identified as being present in 10 of the assayed tumor DNA PROFESSIONAL SERVICES FINDINGS Incorporates analyses of peer reviewed studies and other publicly available information identified by Foundation Medicine these analyses and information may include associations between a molecular alteration or lack of alteration and one or more drugs with potential clinical benefit or potential lack of clinical benefit including drug candidates that are belng studied in clinical research Note A finding of biomarker alteration does not necessarily indicate pharmacologic effectiveness or lack thereof of any drug or treatment regimen a finding of no biomarker

this Report must be considered in conjunction with all other relevant information regarding a particular patient before the patient s treating physician Tecommends a course of treatment Decisions on
