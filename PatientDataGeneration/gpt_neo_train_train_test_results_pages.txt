due to the patient s personal medical history past surgeries and other treatments Patients with a past history of cancer benign tumors or pre cancerous findings may be candidates for long term surveillance and risk reduction strategies beyond what is necessary for the beatment of their initiat diagnosis Any discussion of medical management options is for general information purposes only

only Men with the HOXB73 variant identified in this individual have been shown to have a greatly increased risk for prostate cancer Risks appear fo be highest in men with a family history of prostate cancer All of the studies to date have focused on men of Europeari ancestry so there is not enough evidence yet to know if this variant in REDACTED leads fo an increased risk for prostate cancer in men of other ancestries Some studies have shown that men with this variant in REDACTED are more likely to be diagnased with prostate cancer at younger ages than men in the general population At this time there are no established cancer risks for women with this variant or other variants in REDACTED Although there are high cancer risks for men with this variant in REDACTED there may be interventions that can reduce these risks The initial guidelines from the Philadeiphia Prostate Cancer Consensus Conference are listed below Since it is likely that these guidelines will change as we lear more about the cancer risks associated with this variant in REDACTED it may be appropriate to interpret these results in consultation with cancer genetics professionals who have expertise in this emerging area of knowledge Notes for Personalized Management INFORMATION ON HOW CANCER RISKS AND MANAGEMENT ARE DETERMINED The myRisk Management Tool provides cancer risk levels based on analysis of genetic test results see myRisk Genetic Result and a summary of medical society management recommendations based on a combined analysis of the genetic test results and when possible personal clinical factors and personal family cancer history Here are some important points to understand as you interpret this test report and decide on the best plan for management Comprehensive patient management The management recommendations presented in this report are a summary of management options recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network NCCN and other medical societies and are general in nature The patient s actual management should be modified based on personal medical histary surgeries and other treatments A comprehensive risk assessment and management plan may take into account this report and other aspects of the patient s personal family medical history e g all known clinical diagnoses as well as lifestyle environmental and other factors Risk estimates based on provider supplied information Same of the risk estimates and management recommendation summaries provided in this report are based on our interpretation of Information supplied by the ordering health care provider on the test request form see Specifications for Personal Family History analysis at myriad com technical specifications The patient s actual risks and appropriate management may be significantly different if details provided for cancer diagnoses ages family relationships or other factors were incorrect omitted arnbiguous or have since changed Please review the clinical history listed on the Clinical Family History Information page of this report to make sure that the information used was provided and interpreted correctly Variability in REDACTED risk estimates REDACTED estimates of breast cancer risk can vary significantly based on the way in which the model is used and the estimate provided here may be higher or lower than what would be calculated by other users For complete details of haw REDACTED calculates REDACTED risk estimates including how REDACTED handles information provided in a format not compatible with the model please see the Specifications for Personal Family History analysis at myriad com technical specifications These Specifications also include information for recalculating the REDACTED breast cancer risk estimate if desired What is meant by High Risk and Elevated Risk In the Genetic Test Result Summary a gene associated cancer risk is described as High Risk for a cancer type if all of the following conditions are met the absolute risk of cancer is approximately 5 or higher the increase in risk aver the general population is approximately 3 fold or higher and there is significant data from muitiple studies supporting the cancer risk estimate A gene is described as Elevated Risk for a cancer type if there is sufficient data to support an increase in cancer risk over the general population risk but not all criteria for High Risk are met INFORMATION FOR FAMILY MEMBERS Family mem REDACTED s should talk fo their healthcare providers about hereditary cancer testing to help define their own risk and assist in the interpretation of this patient s genetic test result This patient s relatives are at risk for carrying the same mutation s and associated cancer risks as this patient Any cancer risks that apply to
